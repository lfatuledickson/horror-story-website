			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>Hi, my author name is EndlessBern, and I write short horror stories as a hobby. <br>
				I have decided to put my writing skills to good use and make this website to bring <br>
				everyone some chills late at night. <br><br>

				If you like my works, please follow me on my social networks, and feel free to support me <br>
				by buying my merch. Purchasing a monthly subscription will grant you full access to all my <br>
				works. A 12-month subscription will additionally give you an opportunity once a year to <br>
				work with me in your own personal horror story.
